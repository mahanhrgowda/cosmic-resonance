# Cosmic Birth Resonance Explorer

## Overview
This Streamlit app takes two names, birth dates, times, and time zones as input and generates fun, mind-titillating outputs based on the triple helix model, block universe theory, and the mantra "Om Śrīṁ Bhūṁ Nīlāṁ Agni-Nābhiṁ Prabodhaya Svāhā". It maps births to divine energies (Śrī, Bhū, Nīlā) and string theory types (open, closed, heterotic), calculates cosmic resonance, harmony scores, and alignment year, with visualizations like 3D helical plots and timelines, using emojis and effects like balloons for fun!

## Link Between Triple Helix Theory and String Theory
The triple helix model, with strands for Śrī, Bhū, and Nīlā Devī, mirrors string theory's open, closed, and heterotic strings in the spacetime continuum. Śrīṁ invokes prosperity through open strings' dynamic interactions (particle-like vibrations in branes, as in Type I theory). Bhūṁ grounds material reality via closed strings' loops (gravitons mediating gravity in all consistent theories, including Type IIA/IIB). Nīlāṁ unifies compassion with heterotic strings' hybrid symmetries (E8×E8 or SO(32) gauge groups addressing low-energy unification, discovered in 1985). Convergence points are wave peaks where these strings align, resonating in the eternal block universe, blending Hindu cosmology with relativity's four-dimensional manifold.

## Features
- Input two birth details (name, date, time, time zone).
- Converts to UTC for cosmic consistency.
- Calculates Z-values (scaled seconds since 1900), dominant energies, string types, resonance score (wave interference cos(phase_diff)), harmony score (3D distance in helical space), and cosmic alignment year (midpoint barycenter).
- Displays fun facts with emojis, 3D Plotly helical plot, and 2D Matplotlib timeline.
- Uses Streamlit's balloons and confetti for celebration.

## Acknowledgements
- Inspired by spiritual yantra, block universe, triple helix model, and string theory.
- Mantra linkage: "Om Śrīṁ Bhūṁ Nīlāṁ Agni-Nābhiṁ Prabodhaya Svāhā" invokes fiery energy at the cosmic center.
- Calculations rooted in science: Z-scaling from relativity-inspired time differences, resonance from quantum wave interference, harmony from Euclidean 3D distance, alignment year as barycenter midpoint.
